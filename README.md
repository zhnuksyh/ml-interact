# ML Interact

Interactive educational tool for visualizing various Machine Learning concepts. This project aims to provide an intuitive and hands-on way to understand the building blocks of modern AI systems.

**Live Demo:** [https://zhnuksyh.github.io/ml-interact/](https://zhnuksyh.github.io/ml-interact/)

## Features

The application is broken down into several interactive modules, each focusing on a specific concept:

- **Chunking**: Visualize how text is split into smaller pieces for processing.
- **Embeddings**: Explore how text is converted into vector representations.
- **Vector Search (RAG)**: Understand Retrieval-Augmented Generation through vector similarity search.
- **Quantization**: See the effects of reducing model precision.
- **Full Pipeline**: visualize the end-to-end flow of an LLM application.
- **LLM Basics**: Learn about the fundamental components of Large Language Models.
- **Inference**: Interact with model inference steps.
- **Vision / OCR**: Explore Optical Character Recognition and vision capabilities.
- **MCP / Tools**: a section for Model Context Protocol and external tools.
